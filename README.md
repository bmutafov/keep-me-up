# Simple Keep PC Awake

A simple quick program that keeps your PC awake by moving your mouse by 1px diagonally every 30 seconds. It has no interface as is intended to be as simple as possible.

# Running via node

To keep with node on your pc you have to perform the following steps:
- Make sure you have Node installed on your machine
- Clone the repository and navigate to folder
- run `npm install`
- run `node index.js`

This will start the awake process and will run until you stop with with `Ctrl+C`.

You can create .bat scripts or bash aliases to quickly start and stop the process when needed.
